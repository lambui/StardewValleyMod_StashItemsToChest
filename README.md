## Customize:  
Default hotkey is Tab but you can change hotkey by changing the config.json file.  
Check out KeyCode.txt file to find your desirable key code.

### Note:  
This mod is compatible with [Chest Anywhere mod](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/518/?).  
I made this mod because [Smartmod](http://community.playstarbound.com/threads/smapi-smartmod.108104/) stops working with the newest version of Stardew Valley and SMAPI and I find the Stash function is extremely useful to pass up on.
